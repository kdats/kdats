ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m a Data Scientist with never ending enthusiasm to learn and tinkering spirit.

Iâ€™m interested in Machine Learning, Data Science, OSS contributions, applied AI

Iâ€™m currently learning quite a bit, and a bit of everything related to Data Science and AI more indepth.

Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on real-world AI/ML/DS use cases â€” agentic systems, data science for fintech, open learning communities, and hands-on projects where AI meets business impact.

Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on applied AI/DS projects â€” especially predictive analytics, credit risk models, agentic systems, and open learning communities (LIB AI, HasGeek, etc.).
